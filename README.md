# NVIDIA PhysX SDK 4.1

This is a copy of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK 4.1 that builds with [Forge](https://github.com/cwbaker/forge).

Changes are made in the *forge-v0.5.x* branch (the default branch for this fork).  These changes will be rebased onto the appropriate branch when updating to newer PhysX versions.

This is still very experimental.  The source under `physx/source` is compiled into a static library on Linux but hasn't been used at all.
